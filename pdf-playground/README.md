Watermaker
==========

A small python script that watermarks any number of pdf files.

How to use?
-----------

You need **python version 3.x** for this to work.

Download **watermarker.py** and run in terminal:

```
$ python watermarker.py 'path/to/pdf.pdf' 'watermark.pdf'
```

You can add the same watermark to any number of pdf files just make sure to include the watermark as the last argument.

Use ``python3`` instead of ``python`` for *MacOs/Linux* or if using ``python`` *doesn't* work.
